READ ME !!!!!

SO OUR PROJECT USES THE TWO EVICTION ALGORITHMS CLOCK AND RANDOM. THERE ARE 2 FILES, PROJECT4RANDOM.C AND PROJECT4CLOCK.C
CLOCK LOOKS AT WHETHER OR NOT THE FILE WAS REFERENCED BY ANOTHER USER AND IF IT WAS IT WILL RESET TO 0 IN CLOCK, ACCORDING TO 
THE REAL ALGORITHM.

RANDOM SEEDS TIME, SO IN ORDER TO EVICT RANDOMLY, THERE MUST BE A WAIT FUNCTION FOR ALL EVICTIONS, OR IT ISNT THAT RANDOM 

WE USE PAGE FAULT HANDLER TO DEAL WITH ACCESS INT POINTER, WHEN A USER WANTS A PAGE. IT WILL FIND OUT WHERE THE PAGE IS STORED AND MOVE IT 
UP THROUGH MEMORY, EVICTING OTHER PAGES TO LOWER MEMORY AS IT DOES THIS

WE HAVE A FIND FREE ENTRY FUNCTION THAT LOOKS THROUGH THE PAGE TABLE AND MARKS DOWN ALL INDEXES THAT ARE PART OF EITHER RAM, SSD OR HANDLER
IT THEN RETURNS AN ENTRY THAT WAS NOT MARKED AS IT WAS 'FREE'

WE USE MUTEXES WHEN DEALING WITH THREADS
