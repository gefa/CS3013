Testing Methology (testing the science of methamphetamines):

Memory Maxer:
	Memory maxer should use the allocating function to allocate 1000 pages. 
	It will then access each of the pages with accessIntptr, print them, and finally unlock each page when it is no longer trying to access it.

	Output: run program for output. too long for text file. will show all 1000 pages allocated

memoryMaxFree:
	this function does the same thing as Memory Maxer with the addition of freeing all the pages once it has finished.
	After freeing all pages the memory max free attempts to access page indexes[20], no pages exist anymore and should print that it does not exist.

	Output: same as memoryMaxer, but then frees memory and prints page doesnt exist when trying to find page
	-->

accessPages: 
	Access Pages will access 10 pages that exist in the page table. Some of these pages will be in ram, some in ssd, and some in hard disk.
	it will run the page fault handler if necessary to put pages into ram and access them for the user.

	Output: run program

tooMany:
	Too many tries to allocate 1001 pages, this will print an error message at the attempt of making page 1001 that there is no more space for pages

	Output: allocating too many returns and error
